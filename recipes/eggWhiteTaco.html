    <p> Recipe is super simple and easy to follow: <strong> Add one tsp of Olive Oil</strong>
    to a pan. Start the heat on Med-High and as soon the oil loosens up, spread the oil around the surface.
    Add <strong>Eggwhites</strong> to the pan and keep on medium heat until it starts solidifying.
    In the meantime, start preparing your fresh veggies.</p>
